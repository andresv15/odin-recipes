# odin-recipes
This project is based on the fundamnetals of html file. Using those commands i would create a webpage about certain food recipes that i would like to share with you.  guys. I would be able to demonstrate the basic foundations of creating a html file. By having elemants and tags to have commands of how we want this webpage to look like, thstructure of it the way you want it to look when people visit the page. W would start it off by uding the boilerplate, which is the the way a html file should like a template of how it should be strucutre to avoid any compliacations down the road. I would input some text to create list dhowing the dish and the recipe of that certain dish abd we would it express it by adding images and links taking you to the recipes correspondiong to the dish you chose.
